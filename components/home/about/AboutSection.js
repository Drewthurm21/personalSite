              Hey! I&apos;m Drew, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a business manager turned software engineer from Overlan Park,
              Kansas. I specialize in the backend, primarily Node and Python, but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job.

              I currently work for CottageCare building tools to help automate their call center.
              I have worked for App Academy and edX as a Software Engineer Instructor as well!
              I'm a tinkerer, builder, continual learner, and an inquisitive mind with a passion
              for coding, problem solving, teaching and training.
            </p>

              Outside of work, I love to travel and go rock climbing. Any given Sunday
              you&apos;ll find me gaming with my son or coding away on a personal project. I
              also teach courses online if you&apos;re looking to learn!

              I&apos;m always looking for new opportunities to merge my
              love of coding with my love for the canvas. If you think
              you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect
