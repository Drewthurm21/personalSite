              Hello! I&apos;m Drew! I&apos;m a business manager turned software engineer from Overland Park,
              Kansas. I can work anywhere across the stack, primarily using Node.js and Python, but
              love building with whatever tech is right for the job.

              I work with lots of companies, building tools to help automate their workflows and quote new clients.
              I have worked for App Academy and edX as a Software Engineer Instructor, as well!
              I&apos;m a tinkerer & builder with an inquisitive mind. I have a passion
              for coding, problem solving, teaching and training.

              Outside of work, I love to travel and go rock climbing. Any given Sunday
              you&apos;ll find me gaming with my son or coding away on a personal project. I
              also teach courses online, if you&apos;re looking to learn!

              I&apos;m currently looking for new opportunities where I can utilize my
              love of coding to help your business increase it&apos;s productivity and avoid extra costs. If you think
              you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect!
